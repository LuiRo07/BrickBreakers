# Brick Breakers

Brick Breakers is a more generic version of the famous Atari breakout game
where you have to break down all the bricks on the top of the screen with
a paddle (as the player) that moves left and right. The game ends when the ball
drops below the screen, so you need to have good reflexes to keep the ball
in play.
